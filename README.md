Private/local server for a 2d anime rpg game. The goal of this project is to replicate the functionality of the official server. Discord server: https://discord.gg/Ztt6Y9vQjF

> [!CAUTION]
> Please note that GitHub is the only official source for EpinelPS. **If you bought it from someone, you got scammed.**

> [!WARNING]
> This project is in an early state so many functions in the game do not work. It is recommended to download the latest build from GitHub actions.

## Usage
Download the latest release/GitHub actions build, and run ServerSelector.Desktop.exe as administrator (to modify DNS hosts file and install a CA cert). Make sure to close the game and launcher first. Select Local server, and then click save. After that, start EpinelPS.exe to start the actual server.

You should be able to register an new account in the launcher (you can enter any email verification code).

To access the admin panel, go to https://127.0.0.1/admin/ and sign in. Note that IsAdmin needs to be true for the user account. Note that this interface does not have anything yet.

To skip stages, a basic command line interface is implemented.
